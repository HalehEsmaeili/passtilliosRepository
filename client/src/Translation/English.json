You see, what you just read is a dream that I could only dream because when I was younger, I had the luxury to actually be a child. To imagine... to dream. I didn't have to worry about survival. My biggest trauma wasn't seeing the death of my beloved ones; it was getting slightly pushed by a kid in a playground. I strongly believe that the micro solutions leading to a better world for us all are somewhere in the fertile imagination of children around the globe... But these days, many can't dream. They don't have any time to discover their lively imagination and harvest it for the good of all... Instead, we are heavily dusting up their bright, beautiful potential with trauma and seeding in their hearts the seeds of hatred rather than love. So, if you guys are in, let's dedicate a good portion of that prize money we end up collecting for this project to a humanitarian cause focused on dreams of children. Let's together dream of a world where children, no matter where they are from, have the luxury we had when we were younger... Let us help them dream and hopefully make this world a better place with their innocent but insanely powerful imaginations.",
