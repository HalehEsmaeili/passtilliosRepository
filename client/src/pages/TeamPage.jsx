            I once read an article by Rod Ebrahimi from Forbes that really stuck with me. 
            He mentioned how without a savvy guide, in the form of a mentor, you may wind up making crucial early mistakes that would have otherwise been avoidable. If you recognize the potential of this project to make a positve impact and you have the experience and knowledge to guide it, I would truly appreciate you getting in contact with me üôÉ.
